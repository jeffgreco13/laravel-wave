# Laravel Wave

A wrapper to use the [Wave][wave-app]'s graphql api in your laravel apps. This package was forked from [subbe/waveapp][subbe-waveapp] and adds some QOL improvements for Laravel devs.

Wave API documentation can be located at:

- [Wave - Developer Portal][wave-documentation-url]
- [API Reference][wave-api-reference]

## Application Setup

To use Laravel Wave, you will need to [create an app][wave-create-an-app] on the developer portal.

After you have created a new app, click in to edit its settings. Create a new Full Access token and copy this to a save place. You will need this in your .env

OAuth flow is not supported by this package. Consider using the [Socialite Wave Provider][socialite-wave] then pass the Access Token to the Wave class at runtime.

## Installation

Require the package using composer:

```bash
composer require jeffgreco13/laravel-wave
```

Update your .env file to include:

```
WAVE_ACCESS_TOKEN= *your full access token*
WAVE_BUSINESS_ID= *ID for the business you wish to interact with*
WAVE_GRAPHQL_URI= *defaults to https://gql.waveapps.com/graphql/public*
```

If you do not know the ID for your business, you can use the following tinker command:

```bash
php artisan tinker
> (new \Jeffgreco13\Wave\Wave())->businesses()
```

## Usage

### Query

$businesses = $wave->businesses();
```

or, with parameters...

```php
$wave = new \Jeffgreco13\Wave\Wave();
$country = $wave->country(['code' => 'US']);
```

### Pagination

Queries like `businesses` and `customers` may require pagination. You can easily build your own loop and increment the 'page' input, or you can use this shortcut:

```php
$wave = new Wave();
$response = $wave->customers(['pageSize'=>20]);
do {
    foreach ($wave->getNodes() as $node) {
        echo "Hello, {$node->firstName}!";
    }
} while($response = $wave->paginate());
```

### Mutation

```php
$wave = new \Jeffgreco13\Wave\Wave();
$customer = [
    "input" => [
        "businessId" => null, // Optional. Will use the businessId from your config/env by default
        "name" => "Genevieve Heidenreich",
        "firstName" => "Genevieve",

];
